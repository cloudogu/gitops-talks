# Personal Conclusion

After migrating to and operating with GitOps in production for > 1 year

* Smoother CI/CD,
  * *everything* declarative
  * faster deployment 
* But: security advantages only when finished migration



# GitOps experience distilled

<i class="fas fa-plus"></i> Has advantages, once established

<i class="fas fa-minus"></i> Mileage for getting there may vary



# Adopt GitOps?

* Greenfield
  * AppOps: Definitely
  * ClusterOps: Depends
* Brownfield: Depends

Note:
* Greenfield - Cloud Infra:
  * single cluster: overkill?,
  * at scale: automation provides advantages
* Brownfield: It might solve certain problems, but migration can cause a lot of effort
