Note:
* At the beginning 
* that is: Hype is just beginning but plateau might be reached rather soon (2-5yrs) 

Note more GitOps Critics
* "I'm really starting to get irritated with "GitOps." Why does CI have to be reinvented for k8s. It's a simple problem. On git commit run "kubectl" Every CI system today can do this, do we have to reinvent "git clone" with ArgoCD/Flux. I question that this is the right approach."

* Carlos Sanchez - GitOps: The Bad and the Ugly "Not designed for programmatic updates" totally agree, we had to do some ugly logic to work around git conflicts (more about it at https://buff.ly/3euUG29 )

There are the challenges, but

* Mature tools
  * very active tool development
  * ArgoCD and Flux CNCF graduation ahead
  * Lots of new tools and integrations emerging, including platforms  
* Vibrant community
  * increasing adoption
  * several dedicated GitOps conferences:   
   GitOps Days, GitOps Con, GitOps Summit, Mastering GitOps ü§©
* I have used GitOps successfully in production for years 

Note:
* increasing adoption -> More and more artices, videos, conferences 
* GitOps Days (Weaveworks), GitOps Con (KubeCon day 0 event); GitOps Summit (cd.con)
* very active tool development: [ArgoCD among CNCF projects with highest velocity](https://mobile.twitter.com/cra/status/1468988578357288962)
* Lots of new tools and integrations emerging, including platforms,: 
  e.g. Public Cloud managed k8s, OpenShift, etc.



# My GitOps experience distilled

<i class="fas fa-plus"></i> Has advantages, once established

<i class="fas fa-minus"></i> Mileage for getting there may vary



# Adopt GitOps?

* Greenfield: Definitely
* Brownfield: Depends

Note:
* Important: IaC always definitely
* Greenfield - Cloud Infra:
  * single cluster: overkill?,
  * at scale: automation provides advantages
* Brownfield: It might solve certain problems, but migration can cause a lot of effort
